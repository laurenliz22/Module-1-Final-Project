# Predicting Price of King County Homes

We were hired to look at data between May 2014 and May 2015 to help predict the price of King County homes based on various features for a Real Estate company located in King County.  The company would like to focus their efforts on homes that will provide them with the largest commissions they can obtain (i.e. the pricest homes).  In our effort to help them understand how to find these homes, we looked at which features would best predict the price of a home in King County.  

Based on our analysis, it appears that criteria within the categories of size, location, quality and view are the best predictors for the price of homes in King County.  In particular, please find which features within each category are the ones we determined as the best predictors of price below: 

Home Size: 
- Number of Bedrooms
- Number of Bathrooms
- Number of Floors
- Square footage of the lot
- Square footage of the living space for the nearest 15 neighbors
- Square footage of the house (excluding the basement)
- Square footage of the basement 

Home Quality: 
- The year the house was last renovated
- How good the condition of the home is (on a scale of 1-5)

Location: 
- The zip code/city of the home 
- If the home is on the water or not

View: (need more understanding behind this feature)
- How many times the home was viewed

We recommend the sales staff focus mostly on homes that are larger in size (with comparable neighbors), have a higher condition rating, were recently renovated, and are located on the water within the cities of Bellevue, Issaquah, Renton and Kirkland.  We also recommend the sales staff focus on homes with larger views, however as mentioned we need more understanding around this feature to be able to dive any deeper into what this entails.
